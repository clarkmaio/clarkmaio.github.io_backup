# telegram ode plot

I've created a Telegram Bot that let me visualize the solution of an ODE by simply writing the equation itself.

To write the bot I've used a wrap I've developed for this purpose. 
You can find the package (and some details about its usage) at my [github page](https://github.com/clarkmaio/TelegramBot).

Ok but this is the boring part... let's focus on the bot itself.

## How to start a session with the bot?
This is simple: just open your telegram app and look for **OdePlot**, click on the first result and then **START** button.

At this point you will see this:
